## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/start) - development platform
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- ESLint with rules AirBnB

### What I learned

This project helped me practice building Angular app, using services for communication between components. It took me around 10h of non-intence work.
I also learned how to change colors of svg icons.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.empty-cart {
  cursor: pointer;

  &:hover svg path {
    fill: $dark-grayish-blue;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

in future I want to continue focusing more on logic of websites (JavaScript)
